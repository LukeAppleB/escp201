Array:
addEntity fee - 62607, 47607, 47607, 47607, 47607
update on 5th - 20197

Key/Pair:
addEntity fee - 41656, 41656, 41656, 41656, 41656
update on 5th - 5739

When executing the addEntity function, which design consumes the most gas (execution cost)? 
Is it a significant difference? Why/why not?
The array method uses slightly more gas when adding. I wouldnt consider it a significant amount more. I think it is just because k/v pairs are slightly less write intensive.

Which solution consumes more gas and why?
The array solution uses more overall, especially when it comes to updating. I think this is due to how you need to loop through it, more loops more gas!
